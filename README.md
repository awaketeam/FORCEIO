## Vision

A customizable blockchain service framework, based on EOSIO, provides efficient, open, secure and scalable blockchain services. 
It lowers the threshold of blockchain technology and application for developers and creates a trustworthy service value channel.

## Features of blockchain service

### 1. Consensus Mechanism

Consensus mechanism determines the implementation method and applicable scenario of blockchain’s data consistency. 
FORCEIO supports not only the native consensus mechanism of EOSIO now, but also the user-customized consensus and endorsement plug-ins in the future. 
It is convenient for users to choose and switch flexibly according to their own business needs.

### 2. Contract Management

FORCEIO platform provides a complete integrated development and debugging environment for smart contracts, which greatly shortens the development cycle and reduces developers’ pressure, and assists software development in a more convenient way. Unlike other platforms, FORCEIO platform can not only perform lexical analysis and syntax checking on smart contracts, but also provide a security checking service to verify compliance and security of smart contracts.

### 3. Resource Model

FORCEIO will support the current mainstream blockchain resource models, such as the mortgage model, fee model, etc. Developers can select appropriate resource models based on their own business forms and complete the construction of blockchain quickly.

### 4. Multi-chain Support

A logical blockchain is a private blockchain system that integrates specific organizations and nodes. Different organizations can establish different logical blockchains and data isolation between chains can be realized. Smart contracts can be deployed on different logical blockchains.

### 5. Open Mechanism

FORCEIO is an open platform that supports EOSIO as well as the underlying blockchain platforms of BTC, ETH, BCH and other great partners. FORCEIO actively focuses on the development of cutting-edge blockchain technology, and is ready to support excellent blockchain technologies in the future.

### 6. Developer Tools

FORCEIO offers a range of tools including the wallet, block explorer and developer framework. It is convenient for developers to develop, maintain and monitor blockchain in a more efficient way, and provide users with more convenient blockchain services.
